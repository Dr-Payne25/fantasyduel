# Type should be one of the following:
# - feat (new feature)
# - fix (bug fix)
# - docs (changes to documentation)
# - style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# - refactor (refactoring production code)
# - test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
# - chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
#
# Scope is optional and can be anything specifying the place of the commit change.
# For example: auth, draft, league, frontend, backend, etc.
#
# Subject is a brief description of the change, written in the imperative mood.
#
# Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast with previous behavior.
#
# Footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place
# to reference GitHub issues that this commit closes.
#
# Example:
# feat(auth): add refresh token rotation
#
# Implement refresh token rotation for improved security. Each time a refresh
# token is used, a new one is generated and the old one is invalidated.
#
# Closes #123
